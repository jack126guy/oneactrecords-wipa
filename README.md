# One Act Records WIP Archive

**Abandoned**: No new work has been done since 2015. The recommended replacement is [Rowboat Music](https://github.com/jack126guy/rowboat-music) which uses a static-site generator (Hugo). The replacement for the WIP Archive addition is the reference system of Rowboat Music. [Compatibility scripts](https://github.com/jack126guy/oar-to-rm-compat) are available to ensure that old URLs still work (including for the WIP Archive). Some (incomplete) documentation is available.

The WIP Archive addition to [One Act Records](http://github.com/jack126guy/oneactrecords) provides a simple list of published works in progress (WIPs) along with download links. WIPs can be filtered by release.

[See it in action](http://anon126.tk/cyanomixer/wipa) for my music.

## Version 0.x Notice

Versions before 1.0 are not yet ready for general use. Using these versions requires technical skill and setup. Musicians who have these skills are encouraged to use it and contribute to development.

## Roadmap

* v0.0.1 - Content on website
* v0.0.1.1 - Bug fixes
* v0.0.1.2 - *Current version*: Remove some "personal information"
* v0.1 - *First fully documented version*
* v1.0 - *First usable version*

## Server Requirements

There are no requirements for PHP or MySQL beyond the requirements of One Act Records.

The versioning of WIPA is (rather poorly) designed to express compatibility with different versions of OAR:

| OAR                     | WIPA               |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| v0.0.1 onward           | v0.0.1.x           |
